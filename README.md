jitimage
========   

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iwyg/jitimage.png?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/iwyg/jitimage)

**Just In Time** image manipulation with integration for [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com/), supports [GD](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php), [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/), and [Imagick](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.imagick.php).


## Installation

Add thapp/jitimage as a requirement to composer.json:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php":">=5.4.0",
        "thapp/jitimage": "~0.1"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer update` or `composer install`

Next step is to tell laravel to load the service provider. In `app/config/app.php` add

```php
  // ...
  'Thapp\JitImage\JitImageServiceProvider' 
  // ...
```
to the `providers` array and add `JitImage` to the alias array:

```php
'aliases' => [
   'JitImage' => 'Thapp\JitImage\Facades\JitImage'
 ],
```

### Publish configuration

```
php artisan config:publish thapp/jitimage
```

## Configuration

##### `route (string)`  

The base route for dynamic image processing   
##### `base (string)`    

The filesystem base path to where your images are stored.

##### `driver (string)`   

The processing driver. Available drivers are `im`, `gd` and `Ã¬magick`
##### `cache.route (string)`    

The base route for retrieving images by their cache id
##### `cache.path (string)`  

Cache directory
##### `cache.environments (array)`  

An array of environments were imagecache should be enabled
##### `cache.prefix (string)`  

Name prefix for cached images
##### `quality (string)`

compression quality, 0 - 100 (higher is better but also larger)
##### `imagemagick (array)`  

This array takes two values: `path`, the path to the imagick binary, and `bin`, the binary name.  
Typically the binary name is `convert`.  
##### `filter (array)`  

An array of available filter that should be enabled by default
##### `recipes (array)`  

An array of predefined parameters that are aliased to a route, e.g.


```php

'recipes' => [
	'thumbs' => '2/200/200/5, filter:gs'
],
```

would create a route 'thumbs' that could be called like `http://example.com/thumbs/path/to/my/image.jpg`.    
Defining recipes will disable dynamic image processing. 
##### `response-type (string)`  

You can choose `generic` or `xsend`. 

**Note:** your server must be capable to handle [x-send headers](https://www.google.com/search?q=x-send+headers&oq=x-send+headers&aqs=chrome.0.57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) when using the
`xsend` response type.

```php
'response-type' => 'generic'
```

##### `trusted-sites (array)`  

A list of trusted sites that deliver assets, e.g. 
```
http://25.media.tumblr.com
```  
or as a regexp 

```  
http://[0-9]+.media.tumblr.(com|de|net)
```  

##### `placeholder (array)` 
If the image is not found a placeholder image will can be shown. Each recipe can have its own placeholder image, or when not defined, the default image is used.
The paths are relative to the base directory as defined above.

```php

'placeholder' => [
  'default' => 'no_image.jpg', // default placeholder image

  'thumbs' => 'no_thumb_image.jpg', // placeholder image for specific recipe
]
```

## Image Processors

### GD  

[GD](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) is the standard php image processing library. Choose `gd` if you have either
no access to imagemagick or to the imagick php extension. 

There're a few downsides when using gd though, e.g. color profiles are not preserved, there's no support for preserving image sequences when processing an animated gif file. 
It also has a larger memory footprint so can become impossible in some cases (memory limitations on shared hosting
platforms, etc.).

### ImageMagick

Imagemagick is an incredible fast and versatile image processing library. Choose `im`
 in your `config.php`, if you have access to the `convert` binary. 

 For further information on imagemagick please visit the [official website](http://www.imagemagick.org/)

### Imagick

Imagick is imagemagick OOP for php. Choose `imagick` if you have the
[imagick](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.imagick.php)
extensions installed but no access to the imagemagick binary.

## Usage

### Dynamic image processing

**A word of warning:** Dynamic image processing can <span class="danger" style="color:red;"><b>harm</b></span> you system and should be disabled in production. 

Anatomy of an image uri:

`{base}/{parameter}/{imagesource}/filter:{filter}`

Parameter consists of one to five components, `mode`, `width`, `height`, `gravity` (crop position), and `background`



An Image url my look like this: `http://exmaple.com/images/2/200/200/5/path/to/my/image.jpg` 
To apply additional filters, the filter url segment is appended. The filter segments starts with `filter:` followed by the filter alias and the filter options. Filters are separated by a double colon `:`, filter parameter are separated by a semicolon `;`, eg `filter:gs;s=100;c=1:circ;o=12`. 

#### Examples


Example URLs (assuming you have set `route` to `'images'` and your images are
stored in `public/uploads/images`.   


**resizing**  
Proportionally resize an image to 200px width:  

`http://example.com/images/1/200/0/uploads/images/image.jpg`

Resize an image to 200 * 200 px, ignoring its aspect ratio :  

`http://example.com/images/1/200/200/uploads/images/image.jpg`

Proportionally resize an image to best fit 400 * 280 px:  

`http://example.com/images/4/400/280/uploads/images/image.jpg`

Scale an image down to 50%:  

`http://example.com/images/5/50/uploads/images/image.jpg`

Limit to 200.000px pixel:  

`http://example.com/images/6/200000/uploads/images/image.jpg`

**cropping**  
Proportionally crop and resize an image to 200px * 200px with a gravity of
5 (center):    

`http://example.com/images/2/200/200/5/uploads/images/image.jpg`


### Predefined image processing 
(will disable dynamic processing)

You can alias your image processing with predefined recipes. 

#### Examples

Map mode 2 crop rescale, with a 200x200 px crop and a grey scale
      filter to `http://example.com/thumbs/uploads/images/image.jpg`:  

```php
	'thumbs' => '2/200/200/5, filter:gs'
```
 
Map mode 1 resize, with a resize of 800px width and a 
greyscale filter to `http://example.com/gellery/uploads/images/image.jpg`:
     
```php
   'gallery' => '1/800/0, filter:gs',
```     
Map mode 4 best fit, with a resize of max 800px width and 600px height, to `http://example.com/preview/uploads/images/image.jpg`:

```php
     
   'preview' => '4/800/600'
```     

#### Modes

**mode 0**  
Pass through, no processing. 

**mode 1** `< width/height >`  
Resizes the image with the given width and height values and ignores aspect
ratio unless one of the values is zero.  

**mode 2** `< width/height/gravity >`  
Resize the image to fit within the cropping boundaries defined in width and height. 

Gravity explained:        

```
-------------  
| 1 | 2 | 3 |  
-------------  
| 4 | 5 | 6 |  
-------------  
| 7 | 8 | 9 |  
-------------  
```

**mode 3** `< width/height/gravity/[color] >`  
Crops the image with cropping boundaries defined in width and height. Will
create a frame if the image is smaller than the cropping area. 

**mode 4** `< width/height >`  
Best fit  within the given bounds.

**mode 5** `< percentage >`  
Percrentual scale. 

**mode 6** `< pixelcount >`  
Pixel limit.

#### Converting image formats (since v0.1.4)

You may utilize [the `Convert` filter](#filter) (`conv`) to convert an image to
a different file format.  

As uri:

```php
// convert png to jpg:
'/images/<params>/<source>/filter:conf;f=jpg'
```

The [`JitImage`](#the-facade-class) class also provides some shortcut methods for this: `toJpeg`,
`toPng`, and `toGif`

```php
// convert png to jpg:
JitImage::source($filePNG)->toJpeg()->get();
JitImage::source($fileJPP)->toPng()->scale(50);
```

#### Filters

JitImage comes with 4 predfined filters, `GreyScale`, `Cirlce`, `Overlay`,
`Colorize`, and `Convert` (since v0.1.3):

(**Note:** since v0.1.4. calling invalid arguments on a filter will throw an
[`\InvalidArgumentException`](http://php.net/manual/en/class.invalidargumentexception.php))

##### GreyScale
```
- alias `gs`  
- options (not available for the `gd` driver) 
	- `b` (Brightness){integer}, 0-100
	- `s` (Satturation){integer}, 0-100
	- `h` (Hue){integer}, 0-100
	- `c` (Contrast){integer} 0 or 1 
```

##### Circle

```
- alias `circ`  
- options 
	- `o` {integer} offset, any positive integer value
```

##### Overlay

```
- alias `ovly`  
- options 
	- `a` (alpha) {float} a float value between 0 and 1
	- `c` (color) {string} hex representation of an rgb value
```

##### Colorize

```
- alias `clrz`  
- options 
	- `c` (color){string} hex representation of an rgb value
```

##### Convert

```
- alias `conv`  
- options 
	- `f` (file format){string} a valid image file extension such as `png`, `jpg`, etc.
```

### The facade class

This is a convenient way to scale images within your blade templates. It will create an imageurl similar to `/jit/storage/2egf4gfg/jit_139e2ead8b71b8c7e.jpg`

**Note**: this won't work if both caching and dynamic processing are disabled.  
**Note**: Filters (including the convert shorthands) must be called **before** any other maipulation method, as `resize`, `scale`, etc. will immediately return the computed filesource as string.

```php
// get the original image:
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.jpg')->get();

// proportionally resize the image have a width of 200px:
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.jpg')->resize(200, 0);

// resize the image have a width and height of 200px (ignores aspect ratio):
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.jpg')->resize(200, 200);

// crop 500px * 500px of the image from the center, creates a frame if image is smaller.
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.jpg')->crop(500, 500, 5);

// You may also specify a background color for the frame:
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.jpg')->crop(500, 500, 5, 'fff');

// crop 500px * 500px of the image from the center, resize image if image is smaller:
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.jpg')->cropAndResize(500, 500, 5);

// resize the image to best fit within the given sizes:
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.jpg')->fit(200, 200);

// crop 200px * 200px of the image from the center, resize image if image is smaller and apply a greyscale filter:
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.jpg')->filter('gs')->cropAndResize(200, 200, 5);

// Percentual scale the image:
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.jpg')->scale(50);

// Limit the image to max. 200000px:
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.jpg')->pixel(200000);

// Convert png to jpg:
JitImage::source('path/to/myimage.png')->toJpeg()->get();

```


## Register external filter

You may add your own filter classes to be used with JitImage. 

(more to come).

```php

Event::listen('jitimage.registerfilter', function ($driverName) {

    return [
        "mf" => sprintf("Namespace\\Filter\MyFilter\\%s%s", ucfirst($driverName) , 'MfFilter')
    ];

});
```


## Caching

### Artisan commands

There's really just one command right now. `php artisan jitimage:clearcache` will clear the whole image cache. 


### Deleting a cached image if its source file got replaced

It is possible to just delete cached images that have been created from
a certain source. So lets assume you have to replace an image called `myimage.jpg` in `uploads/images`, 
you could tell the cache class to to remove this specific cache directory. 

```php
$app['jitimage.cache']->delete('uploads/images/myimage.jpg');
```

You may also hoock this up to an upload event

```php

// attention! pseudo code:

Event::listen('image.upload', function ($event) use ($app) {
	$app['jitimage.cache']->delete($event->image);
});

```

### API

API documentation will be updated shortly.
